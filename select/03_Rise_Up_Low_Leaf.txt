I fell from an island in the sky
I don't remember why
To feel energy up my spine
Got 2 activate my inner central light

Come on, divine people
Can you feel it? people
Can you feel it? people
Come on, divine people
Can you feel it?

I drink from the cup of life
The key to transcend mind

Let go of fear, don't stress
Cuz love is here
