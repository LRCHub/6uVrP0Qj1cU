[00:10.77] I was hoping for an indication
[00:13.21] I was seeking higher elevation
[00:15.73] (Aye-aye-aye, aye-aye-aye)
[00:20.82] I've been shaken, waking in the night light
[00:23.43] I've been breaking, hiding from the spotlight
[00:25.91] (Aye-aye-aye, aye-aye-aye)
[00:38.91] 
[00:30.54] The more I stray, the less I fear
[00:33.19] And the more I reach, the more I fade away
[00:40.61] The darkness right in front of me
[00:43.08] Oh, it's calling out, and I won't walk away
[01:04.58] 
[00:49.78] I would always open up the door
[00:52.35] Always looking up for higher floors
[00:55.04] Want to see it all, give me more (rise, rise up)
[01:00.19] I was always up for making changes
[01:02.64] Walking down the street meeting strangers
[01:05.11] Flipping through my life, turning pages (rise, rise up)
[01:32.61] 
[01:11.90] Like a prayer that only needs a reason
[01:14.55] Like a hunter waiting for the season
[01:17.03] (Aye-aye-aye, aye-aye-aye)
[01:22.02] I was there, but I was always leaving
[01:24.74] I've been living, but I was never breathing
[01:27.38] (Aye-aye-aye, aye-aye-aye)
[01:40.38] 
[01:31.84] The more I stray, the less I fear
[01:34.28] And the more I reach, the more I fade away
[01:41.74] The darkness right in front of me
[01:44.34] Oh, it's calling out, and I won't walk away
[02:05.84] 
[01:51.29] I would always open up the door
[01:53.79] Always looking up for higher floors
[01:56.25] Want to see it all, give me more (rise, rise up)
[02:01.34] I was always up for making changes
[02:04.01] Walking down the street meeting strangers
[02:06.53] Flipping through my life, turning pages (rise, rise up)
[02:34.03] 
[02:13.26] I'm bursting like the Fourth of July
[02:18.65] So color me and blow me away
[02:27.85] I'm broken in the prime of my life
[02:33.30] So embrace it and leave me to stray
[02:50.80] 
[02:41.26] I would always open up the door
[02:43.80] Always looking up for higher floors
[02:46.29] Want to see it all, give me more (rise, rise up)
[02:51.66] I was always up for making changes
[02:54.18] Walking down the street meeting strangers
[02:56.57] Flipping through my life, turning pages (rise, rise up)
[03:24.07] 
[03:01.62] I would always open up the door
[03:04.42] Always looking up for higher floors
[03:06.77] Want to see it all, give me more (rise, rise up)
[03:12.06] I was always up for making changes
[03:14.54] Walking down the street meeting strangers
[03:17.16] Flipping through my life, turning pages (rise, rise up)
[03:44.66] 
[03:29.91] (Rise, rise up)
[03:37.41] 
[03:39.96] (Rise, rise up)
