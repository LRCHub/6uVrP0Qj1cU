Black dog is calling
He's singing softly
Oh, he knows that I'm awake

An old friend of mine
The one and only
Who always knew what he can take

I feel this emotion
I don't believe
I don't believe a single word you say
There's so much devotion
I can't stand it, I can't stand it

I'm gonna rise up, rise up
I'ts time time time to get up now
Life is too good good good to give up

I'm gonna stand up, stand up
It's time time time to get up now
Life is to good good good to give up

And everybody goes ohhhhh...

So what's the point
Of being happy
When everytime I get undone

I see no solution, I don't see it
No, I don't see how I will get out of this
There's so much confusion
I can't stand it, I can't stand it

I'm gonna rise up, rise up
It's time time time to get up now
Life is too good good good to give up
I'm gonna stand up, stand up
It's time time time to get up now
Life is too good good good to give up

And everybody goes ohhhhh...

I'm gonna rise up, rise up
It's time time time to get up now
Life is too good good good to give up
I'm gonna stand up, stand up
It's time time time to get up now
Life is too good good good to give up

And everybody goes ohhhhh...

I've been called by a black dog.
