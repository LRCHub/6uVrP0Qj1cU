# TheFatRat – Rise Up

> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
When you feel it's hopeless
When you think that you lost, oh
I will take your hand and
We'll rise up from the dust, oh
Here we go go go
Let us heal and grow
You won't be alone
We're unstoppable
Don't be afraid to show
What we're going for
This is what we know
Here we come back to life,
we're still breathing
Standing up, everybody's gonna
see it
Oh all you need to know is that
we're holding on
Even if we fall we will rise up
And we follow the path that
we believe in
No we're not gonna stop until
we reach it
Oh all you need to know is that
we're holding on
We rise up from the dust and
claim our throne
We rise up from the dust and
claim our throne
(Throne, throne, throne)
We all have our reasons
Why we are on this track, oh
We all have our burdens yeah but
We just keep on fighting and we
never look back
Here we go go go
Let us heal and grow
You won't be alone
We're unstoppable
Don't be afraid to show
What we're going for
This is what we know
Here we come back to life,
we're still breathing
Standing up,
everybody's gonna see it
Oh all you need to know is that
we're holding on
Even if we fall we will rise up
And we follow the path that we
believe in
No we're not gonna stop until we
reach it
Oh all you need to know is that
we're holding on
We rise up from the dust and
claim our throne
We rise up from the dust and
claim our throne
(Throne, throne, throne)
We rise up from the dust and
claim our throne
(Throne, throne, throne)
